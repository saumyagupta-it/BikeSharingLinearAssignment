## General Information
Boombikes is a US based bike-sharing service provider. It is facing difficulties to sustain due to the dips in their revenues because of the pandemic. To overcome the current challenges, they have decided to understand the demand of sharing bikes among the people based on different factors, which will help them to accerlerate their revenue once the lockdown comes to an end.

Essentially, the company wants â€”

To variables which are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## Conclusions
- Major factor impacting the demand of bikes are temperature and wheather season.
